            <h1>June 20, 2019</h1>
            <p>So this is really happening, huh? I'm getting my own blog.</p>
            <p>
              The opportunity to bring unique, new content to the world is an
              awesome one, and it begins with learning how to code.
            </p>
            <p>
              Not gonna lie. Coding isn't exactly easy to pick up unless you
              have a missing - something in mind that you want to build.
            </p>
            <p>
              And for me, as a Systems Engineer, the need for coding
              (incorrectly) seemed unnecessary.
            </p>
            <p>
              That changed when I discovered just how powerful Powershell can
              be.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a Systems Administrator, or Engineer, the number of hours saved
              by scripting and automating skills was unbelievable,
              <br />
              and picking up Powershell wasn't particularly hard.
            </p>
            <p>Here are the resources I recommend checking out ASAP:</p>

            <p>
              Powershell, like Python, is great for learning coding
              fundamentals, like what variables do, loops, objects, and so much
              more.
            </p>
            <p>
              And most importantly, as a Systems Engineer or Administrator (and
              DBA!), you can apply what you learn almost immediately.
            </p>
            <p>
              THEN, once you have those coding fundamentals down, you can tackle
              more challenging languages like JavaScript and C#
